# TO DO

## Code

- Benchmark enhanced GT4py V
- Convert to JAX
  - JAX earth.py, check for control flow V
  - Do ticking_earth.py V
  - Static args expected if almost not change, how define them dynamic ?  => no use of static args anymore V
  - Will attribute as parameters in jitted function work ? V
  - Attributes used in jitted function ? => compile with value init, not modified further then no problem V
  - !!! Code works, perfoms pretty well, nice scaling, precision similar to GT4py V
  - Didn't adapt the energy transfer not including boundaries
- Benchmark JAX V
- Do BENCHMARK before/after caching
- 
## Memoire

- GT4PY JAX ICON4PY etc (**Notes.md**)
- Old memorants
- Discuss results
- cant find validate arguments
- Give ccl
