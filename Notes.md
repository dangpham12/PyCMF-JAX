## JAX

JAX is a numerical computing library that allows users to write high-performance code in Python. It provides automatic differentiation, just-in-time compilation, and GPU/TPU support, making it suitable for machine learning and scientific computing tasks.

### Key Features
- **Automatic Differentiation**: JAX provides automatic differentiation capabilities, allowing users to compute gradients and higher-order derivatives of functions with ease. This is particularly useful for optimization problems and machine learning tasks.
- **Just-In-Time Compilation**: JAX can compile Python functions to optimized machine code using the XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler. This enables significant performance improvements, especially for large-scale numerical computations.
- **GPU/TPU Support**: JAX can run on GPUs and TPUs, leveraging their parallel processing capabilities for faster computations. This is particularly beneficial for deep learning and other compute-intensive tasks.
- **Functional Programming Paradigm**: JAX encourages a functional programming style, where functions are treated as first-class citizens. This allows for more modular and reusable code.
- **Array Operations**: JAX provides a NumPy-like API for array operations, making it easy for users familiar with NumPy to transition to JAX. It supports a wide range of array operations, including element-wise operations, reductions, and broadcasting.
- **Composability**: JAX functions can be composed together, allowing users to build complex computations from simpler ones. This composability is a key feature that enables users to create reusable components and pipelines.
- **Ecosystem**: JAX has a growing ecosystem with libraries like Flax for neural networks, Optax for optimization, and Haiku for building complex models. These libraries provide additional functionality and abstractions for specific
- **Interoperability with NumPy**: JAX is designed to be compatible with NumPy, allowing users to leverage existing NumPy code and libraries. This makes it easier for users to adopt JAX without having to rewrite their entire codebase.

### Problems

Currently Jax is not really compatible with GT4Py, as we permanently use gtscript.Field and gtscript.function that cannot be optimized by Jax.

## DaCE

DaCE (Data-Centric Execution) is a framework for high-performance computing that focuses on data-centric programming models. It allows users to express computations in a way that is independent of the underlying hardware, enabling automatic optimization and parallelization.
### Key Features
- **Data-Centric Programming**: DaCE emphasizes a data-centric approach, where computations are expressed in terms of data transformations rather than specific algorithms. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability to different hardware architectures.
- **Automatic Optimization**: DaCE can automatically optimize computations for various hardware platforms, including CPUs and GPUs. This is achieved through a combination of static analysis and runtime optimization techniques.
- **Parallel Execution**: The framework supports parallel execution of computations, allowing users to take advantage of multi-core and distributed systems. This is particularly useful for large-scale data processing tasks.
- **Structured Grids**: DaCE is designed to work with structured grids, making it suitable for applications in scientific computing, such as weather and climate modeling.
- **Extensibility**: Users can extend the framework with custom operators and transformations, allowing for greater flexibility in expressing complex computations.
- **Integration with Python**: DaCE is designed to work seamlessly with Python, allowing users to leverage existing Python libraries and tools. This makes it easier for users to adopt DaCE without having to learn a new programming language.
- **Community and Ecosystem**: DaCE has a growing community and ecosystem, with various libraries and tools built around it to facilitate development and deployment of high-performance applications.
